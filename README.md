# Byrne's Elements of Euclid diagram system

This repo contains the progress on a systematization exercise of diagrams found in [Byrne's Elements of Euclid](https://personal.math.ubc.ca/~cass/euclid/byrne.html).

## Running project

This was built using [Mechanic](https://github.com/designsystemsinternational/mechanic), so it can be run and managed as any Mechanic project.

To run and see your design functions in action right away, just call:

```
npm run dev
```

This will bundle and serve in place a web app that you can open and interact with in your own browser. That way you can test out the code of you design functions, start prototyping assets and exporting them.

Alternatively, you can first built the app, which will generate a folder with the code transformed:

```
npm run build
```

And to serve that already built app and interact with it in a browser, run:

```
npm run serve
```
